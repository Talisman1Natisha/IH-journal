          <summary>Private Privilege vs. The Common Good</summary>
          <p>
            A wealthy woman asks Archbishop Romero for a
            private baptism because she does not want to share the church with
            the country’s poor. Romero refuses, insisting that there are “no
            private baptisms anymore.” The conflict recalls George Orwell’s
            critique in <em>The Road to Wigan Pier</em>: middle‑class reformers
            support equality in theory but recoil from proximity to those who
            labor for them. By holding the baptism in the crowded nave,
            Romero insists that a just community is built when
            privileges, spiritual or economic, are shared, not hoarded.
          </p>

          <summary>Mandate of Heaven vs. Unjust Rule</summary>
          <p>
            At breakfast, the President‑Elect and a general discuss “law and
            order” while feasting on lavish food. When Romero pleads for
            information about a missing priest, they dismiss him with claims
            that development and jobs justify their regime. Confucius’s
            <em>Analects</em> argue that legitimate rule requires <em>te</em>
            (virtue) and <em>ren</em> (humaneness). Without benevolence and
            attention to individual suffering, material growth becomes mere
            tyranny, what Fanon might call colonial violence in a new form.

          <summary>Reciprocity and Hoarding</summary>
          <p>
            Endless rows of coffee and sugarcane fields fill the screen while
            emaciated campesinos harvest for export. Robin Wall Kimmerer’s
            concept of the “Honorable Harvest” insists we take only what we
            need and leave enough for the community and the earth to heal.
            El Salvador’s elites exhibit a <em>Windigo</em> mindset, exporting
            wealth and leaving their neighbors hungry. Romero’s liberation
            theology echoes Indigenous wisdom: the land belongs to the
            community (or God), not to those with the largest bank accounts.

          <summary>The Universal “We”</summary>
          <p>
            In his final sermon, broadcast on the radio, Romero turns to the
            soldiers and implores: “I beg you, I implore you, I order you…
            stop the repression!” Gloria Anzaldúa’s idea of a
            <em>mestiza</em> consciousness, an identity that embraces
            multiplicity, resonates here. By reminding the soldiers that they
            are killing their own sisters and brothers, Romero seeks to heal
            the borders erected between oppressor and oppressed. The common
            good demands we recognize a shared humanity beyond class or
            uniform.

          <summary>Building the City of God</summary>
          <p>
            In Aguilares, soldiers convert a church into a barracks.
            Later Romero leads the people in reclaiming the sanctuary,
            adorning it with flowers and song. Christine de Pizan’s
            <em>City of Ladies</em> envisions an allegorical city built by
            Reason, Rectitude and Justice to protect those defamed by power.
            When Romero and the peasants cleanse their church and return to
            worship, they lay a brick in that moral city. The common good
            becomes a physical space where virtue, not violence, offers
            security.

          <summary>Violence and the Fracture of the Common</summary>
          <p>
            Father Osuna is tortured by the army; guerillas kidnap and kill
            members of the elite. Frantz Fanon reminds us in
            <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em> that what the colonizer calls
            “peace” is often simply compliance under duress. Romero hopes for
            a non‑violent common good, but Fanon would argue that
            decolonization inevitably involves bloodshed. The cycle of
            violence reveals how far society has drifted from any shared
            moral order.

          <summary>Radical Solidarity in Crisis</summary>
          <p>
            In perhaps the film’s most moving sequence, Romero enters a town
            occupied by soldiers to retrieve the Eucharist. One by one, the
            townspeople follow him, forming a human shield. Slavoj Žižek’s
            pandemic essays argue that true common good demands “war
            communism” in times of crisis, a radical solidarity that
            transcends individual survival. By risking their lives for the
            dignity of their community, these villagers embody the ethic
            Žižek describes.

          <summary>Failure of the Collective</summary>
          <p>
            The central conflict between Ben and Harry Cooper echoes
            Confucius’s insistence on ritual propriety (<em>li</em>) and
            humaneness (<em>ren</em>). Ben boards windows, organizes
            defences and urges cooperation; Harry wants to retreat to the
            cellar with his family. The farmhouse becomes a microcosm of
            class struggle: the upstairs represents collective action,
            embodied by the Black working‑class protagonist; the cellar
            represents bourgeois hoarding. Without a shared moral order, the
            group descends into chaos.

        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>The Outsider and the State</summary>
          <p>
            Ben survives the night only to be mistaken for a ghoul and shot
            by a white sheriff’s posse at dawn. Fanon’s analysis of the
            colonized subject is painfully literal here: the Black man is
            rendered invisible as a human and instead perceived as a monster.
            Anzaldúa’s border theory suggests Ben inhabits an in‑between
            space, neither accepted by the white family in the house nor
            fully assimilated into the zombie horde. His death underscores
            how the “common good” constructed by state authorities excludes
            those marked as other.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Crisis and Solidarity</summary>
          <p>
            As survivors huddle around radios and televisions, confused
            government broadcasts blame a Venusian probe for the outbreak.
            Žižek likens such crises to pandemics: without radical
            solidarity, we revert to barbarism. The characters fail to
            internalize that they are “all in the same boat,” turning on
            one another instead of the undead outside.
          </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Gender and Voice</summary>
          <p>
            Women in the farmhouse are silenced or ignored. Barbara is
            catatonic; Judy is scolded to “just sit there”; Helen Cooper’s
            practicality is overruled by her husband. Christine de Pizan’s
            <em>Book of the City of Ladies</em> imagines a city where women’s
            voices construct the common good. The collapse of the
            farmhouse-city suggests that when women are barred from
            decision‑making, the social fabric tears as surely as boards
            splinter under ghoul hands.

          <summary>The Common Good &amp; Philosophical Connections</summary>
          <p>
            Confucius teaches that true
            common good emerges when rites and benevolence are observed even
            toward the dead. Mizushima refuses to return home until he has
            buried the soldiers’ bodies, restoring the moral order of the
            universe. Gloria Anzaldúa would call him a
            <em>nepantlera</em>: one who walks between worlds (life and death,
            Japan and Burma) to heal a cultural wound. Kimmerer’s emphasis
            on reciprocity resonates. Mizushima gives his labor freely to the
            fallen who can offer nothing material in return. Fanon argued
            that colonial violence demands a violent response, yet this film
            imagines a post‑violence act of restitution. Žižek suggests
            catastrophe forces us to see what matters; for Mizushima, only
            compassion and burial endure when empire falls.

          <summary>The Fractured Common Good</summary>
          <p>
            Colonel Mathieu warns the French public: if Algeria remains
            part of France, you must accept the “consequences.” George
            Orwell reminds us that comforts enjoyed by the metropole are
            built on hidden violence, in this case, torture and occupation.
            The common good of the colonizer requires the suffering of the
            colonized. Fanon argues that such a system cannot be reformed;
            it must be overthrown.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Who Defines “Order”?</summary>
          <p>
            A propaganda voiceover claims the FLN is “a minority which rules
            through terror and violence”; the response is to isolate and
            destroy them. Confucius says a ruler should lead by virtue so
            that the people follow like grass bending before the wind. The
            French, ruling without benevolence, have forfeited their
            Mandate of Heaven. Žižek notes that states treat rebellion as
            disease, imposing curfews and suspending rights. In the name of
            the common good, torture is rationalized and due process
            forgotten.

          <summary>Identity &amp; Borders</summary>
          <p>
            Algerian women cut their hair and don Western dresses to slip
            through checkpoints and plant bombs. Anzaldúa’s
            <em>Borderlands</em> describes living between cultures. Here,
            women weaponize that liminality, becoming literal shapeshifters
            for the revolution. Christine de Pizan argued that women are
            builders of cities; in Algiers they build a new nation by
            destroying colonial architecture.

          <summary>Land &amp; Extraction</summary>
          <p>
            Tanks roll over narrow streets; checkpoints carve the city into
            zones. Kimmerer teaches that land is a relative, not a resource.
            Colonialism treats it as something to be extracted and policed.
            The Casbah fighters move organically through their environment;
            the French feel like an imposition. The common good for
            Algerians means returning the land to those who live in
            reciprocity with it.
